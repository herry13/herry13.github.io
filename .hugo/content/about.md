I am a Senior Software Engineer at [PROWLER.io](https://prowler.io).
I build the Cloud infrastructure to run large scale AI experiments and products.
I also develop frameworks to run machine learning algorithms on the Cloud.

Previously, I was a Research Associate at School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow (2017-2018),
and a Research Engineer at Hewlett Packard Labs, Hewlett Packard Enterprise in Bristol (2015-2017).

I received Ph.D. (2014) from the University of Edinburgh,
B.Sc. (2002) and M.Sc. (2004) from Universitas Indonesia.
I spent about 1-year (2003-2004) as visiting research student
in Tokyo Institute of Technology.

I am a football fan, also like to play table tennis, chess,
badminton, and in-door football.
Sometimes I take various photos with my Nikon camera.
