I am a Research Associate at School of Computing Science,
University of Glasgow, working on [Federated RaspberryPi &mu;-Infrastructure
Testbed (FR&mu;IT)](https://fruit-testbed.org) project.
My works focus on solving problems on managing a large scale distributed system
to support Edge Compute or the Internet of Things applications.

I received Ph.D. (2014) from the University of Edinburgh,
B.Sc. (2002) and M.Sc. (2004) from Universitas Indonesia.
I spent about 1-year (2003-2004) as visiting research student
in Tokyo Institute of Technology.

I am a football fan, also like to play table tennis, chess,
badminton, and in-door football.
Sometimes I take various photos with my Nikon camera.
