      <description>I am a Research Associate at School of Computing Science, University of Glasgow, working on Federated RaspberryPi &amp;mu;-Infrastructure Testbed (FR&amp;mu;IT) project. My works focus on solving problems on managing a large scale distributed system to support Edge Compute or the Internet of Things applications.
I received Ph.D. (2014) from the University of Edinburgh, B.Sc. (2002) and M.Sc. (2004) from Universitas Indonesia.</description>

      <description>More than 18 millions of Raspberry Pis have been sold &amp;lsquo;til today. This small, cheap computer has been popular to hobbyist or students as platform to deploy sensor applications, or to create a micro data center.
Although it looks powerless comparing to standard desktop computer or laptop, but the latest models (Raspberry Pi 3 and 3B+) are capable of executing ARM 64-bit instructions since their processors are based on ARMv8 architecture.</description>
